Github is an app where you can build many different types of code. Recently, I have been using Github to learn Ruby and develop different tests, projects, and methods.

Why is Github useful?

Github is useful because it provides an environment that will allow a programmer to create and organize files to test codes, create different games, and command line applications. 

What is your favorite Github feature?

I love how Github's application can post my codes and projects online to be viewed by everyone. When I need assistance on certain projects and request help, I can post a link that will show the code I've been working on within the app. This helps streamline the process of sharing and correcting codes.

Is Github essential for learning code?

I definitely believe so. It is interactive, easy to share, accessible, and very functional. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn code and is looking for an easy enviroment to code in.
