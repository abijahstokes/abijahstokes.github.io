Metaprogramming is defined as the way computers can treat their programs as data and even edit them as they run. Isn't it amazing how we have created technology that behaves like the antibodies within our immune system?

Metaprogramming performs and behaves similarly to how we intake information as humans. When we learn something new, we take that information and apply it to our lives. We treat the new things that we learn as data. When information evolves, our perceptions and consciousness expand, and we become more aware, we are implementing the same aspects that computers utilize.

It is amazing the work programmers have done in order to advance how computers function and improve technology as a whole. Hopefully, we can continue to use our talents to improve our lives, communities, and to make our world a more efficient place to live.
