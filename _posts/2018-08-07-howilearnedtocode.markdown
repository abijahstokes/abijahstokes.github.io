The year is 2006, your friends and associates are pressing you because they are not in your top 8. You have the dopest Myspace page around, custom cursors, falling glitter, embedded videos and pictures, fancy posts in the font and color of your choice, you have it all.

This is how I got interested in coding, I didn't know what I was doing. I just knew if I had this code <a href="blah blah.. I can make magic happen.

I was HTML helpdesk before I knew it, my friends would ask me to helped them make their page just as elaborate as mine. "Why does my font look like <p> when I want it bigger?," they'd ask. I would say "You need <h1> and make sure you include the alligator mouth >. Not knowing your tags need to have open and closing brackets. 

My little bit of self-taught HTML skills came in handy being an intern and creating websites on Adobe Muse and learning about CSS. Eventually I became a professional graphic designer and a social media coordinator, but I wanted more. I saw many of my college friends have great success in the IT field and I decided this year, 2018, I want to take things to the next level.

Now here I am, learning with the Flatiron School
